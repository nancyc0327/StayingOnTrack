<h2>How Do I Know My Child is Ready?</h2>
<p>Perhaps this is the most frequently asked question and the one that is the most difficult to answer. There are many opinions and much research about what it means to be ready.</p>
<p> School readiness is about more than what your child knows. Kindergarten teachers say ready children are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> healthy, rested, and well fed</li>
  <li> able to pay attention, follow directions and communicate their thoughts and needs without being disruptive</li>
  <li> curious and    enthusiastic about    new activities</li>
  <li> confident, cooperative</li>
  <li> and able to practice</li>
  <li> age-appropriate</li>
  <li> self control.</li>
</ul>
<p>Children enter kindergarten with a wide variety of skills and knowledge. There is not just one thing, nor a list of skills, that makes a child ready for school. In fact, you should consider all areas of your child’s development, not just her/his academic skills. See the resources section at the end of this booklet for ideas on how you can support your child’s school readiness.</p>
<p> In Nebraska, the only requirement for kindergarten entrance is age-eligibility: your child turns five on or before July 31. Therefore, it is not a question of whether your age-eligible child is ready for kindergarten. Rather, it is a question of how can you support your child’s transition to school, which includes helping the school be ready for your child.</p>
