<h2>Support Growth and Learning</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To develop trust, your baby needs to know that her needs will be met.</li>
  <li>Respond to your babys cries- it is her form of communication.</li>
  <li>Hold and cuddle your baby; you wont spoil her.</li>
  <li>Use a soft tone of voice; smile and express positive emotions with your baby.</li>
  <li>Be reassuring when your baby starts to notice the difference between friends and strangers.</li>
  <li>Protect your baby from being over stimulated. You'll learn to read his signals that he's ready to play (smiling, cooing or looking) or that he needs a change of activity (looking away, yawning or fussing).</li>
  <li>Pace your timing when you play with your baby. When you talk to him pause nd wait for him to talk back to you.</li>
  <li>When he is awake, time on his tummy helps your baby strengthen his neck, legs and upper body.</li>
  <li>Help your baby learn to communicate by reading his expressions, body movements and sounds. When he smiles, smile back, and when he is upset, comfort him. As he gets older, name things in his world, like rattle, book or bath.</li>
  <li>Look directly at your baby when you talk and play together.</li>
  <li>Play games with your baby, like pat-a-cake and peek-a-boo.</li>
  <li>Give your baby safe opportunities to move and explore.</li>
  <li>Babies have very short memories, so you will need to repeat things many times before he understands and learns what you are saying.</li>
  <li>As your baby gets older, help him learn to stop when you say no by leading him to a more appropriate activity.</li>
  <li>Tiny babies like toys with bright colors or contrasting patterns. Small, soft rattles that are easy to hold are fun.</li>
  <li>As your baby becomes more active, he will like toys that make music, pop-up, roll, or make other sounds.</li>
  <li>As he becomes more mobile, your baby will like push-and-pull toys, stacking and nesting toys, balls, dolls and stuffed animals, and large building blocks.<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Share Books with your Baby</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Choose sturdy books with simple, bright, uncluttered pictures against solid backgrounds.</li>
  <li>As he learns to grasp things, pick light, washable, nontoxic cloth or soft vinyl books.</li>
  <li>Hold your baby in your lap and circle your arms gently around him as you read or point to and talk about the pictures in the book.</li>
  <li>Choose books with rhythm, rhyme and repetition.</li>
  <li>Choose books with large pictures that look like the real thing.<br />
  </li>
</ul>
