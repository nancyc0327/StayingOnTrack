	The Early Development Network can help you and your family support and promote your child's development, within your family activities and community life. Nebraska's Early Development Network supports children birth through three years of age who have special developmental needs. The Nebraska Early Development Network program 'connects' families with early intervention services, such as occupational, speech or physical therapy, to help infants and toddlers grow and develop and help their families in this process. It is a voluntary program and does not discriminate based on race, culture, religion, income level, or disability. 
</p>

<p>
	Infants and young children are learning about their environment and developing skills in many areas at the same time. Every child is unique and differences in their rate of development can be expected. One child may walk earlier than another or talk later than most children. There is no one measure to identify delays as growth and development are interactive and on-going. However, there are some guidelines to help parents and professionals to determine how a child compares with most children their age. It is important to remember that these are merely <em><strong>GUIDELINES</strong></em>. A child's development may be affected by many factors including illness, physical environment, genetic make-up, etc. A child may show a delay in one area followed by a growth spurt in the same area in later months. 
</p>
<p>
	A delay in any of these areas could be a sign that you may need to have it checked out. Talk with your doctor or nurse about you child's development or get in touch with the Early Development Network.
