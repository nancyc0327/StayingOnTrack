<h2>Tips to Keep Your Baby Safe (0-18 months):</h2>
<ul>
  <li>NEVER SHAKE YOUR BABY! It wont stop her from crying, and she could suffer permanent brain damage or even death.</li>
  <li>Nebraska law requires that children up to 6 years of age be in restraints when riding in a vehicle. From birth to at least one year old and at least 20 pounds, your baby should be in a rear-facing infant or convertible seat in the back seat of the car.</li>
  <li>One of the most important jobs you have as a parent is keeping your child safe when riding in a vehicle. Each year thousands of young children are killed or injured in car crashes. Proper use of car seats helps keep children safe. For information on proper care seat installation and safety guidelines please review our <a href="car-seat-safety.html">car seat safety tips.</a></li>
  <li>Make sure the crib is safe. The mattress should be firm, have a fitted sheet and fits snuggly so you can get no more than the width of your two fingers between the mattress and crib. A soda can should not fit through the railings. Fluffy blankets, comforters, stuffed animals, and bumper pads pose a real danger of suffocation and should not be in the crib. Make sure your babys face remains uncovered during sleep.</li>
  <li>Always place your baby on her back when putting her to sleep, unless your doctor directs you otherwise. Also remember, parents and babies should be close, but adult beds were not made with infant safety in mind.<br />
  </li>
  <li>Keep the sleeping room at a temperature comfortable for a lightly clothed adult. Your baby can wear a one-piece sleeper with nothing over her. If its cold, layer her clothing. </li>
  <li>Make sure your baby is never left alone on any surface from which she can fall, such as the changing table, couch or the bed.</li>
  <li>Remember to strap your baby into the swing, stroller and highchair.</li>
  <li>Use a stationary activity center rather than a baby walker. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends not using walkers because they can tip over easily and allow your baby to get into dangerous places that she otherwise would not be able to reach.</li>
  <li>As your baby becomes more active and can move around on her own, watch out for poisonous plants, dangling cords, open stairways, electric outlets, pieces of plastic or a balloon, poisons or medicine, sharp edges, and small objects on the floor. Use baby gates and outlet covers to keep her safe.</li>
  <li>Avoid foods that can cause choking, such as popcorn, pretzels, chips, hot dogs, spoonfuls of peanut butter, raw carrots, celery, mini-marshmallows, raisins and other dried fruits, and whole grapes.</li>
  <li>If your house was built before 1978, check that all the paint in your home is lead free and non-toxic.</li>
  <li>Learn infant/toddler CPR and first aid.</li>
  <li>Never leave your baby unattended in the bathtub or around any water. Empty all containers with water immediately after use. Babies can drown in as little as 1 of water.</li>
  <li>Babies under the age of 1 should stay out of the direct sunlight.</li>
  <li>Apply a generous amount of sunscreen and lip balm with SPF 15, or higher, 15-30 minutes before going outside. Sunscreen should not be used on babies under 6 months.</li>
</ul>
