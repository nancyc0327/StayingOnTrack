<h2>Tips to Keep Your Child Safe (3-5 years):</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Nebraska law requires that children up to 6 years of age be in restraints when riding in a vehicle. From age one to about age four and 20-40 pounds, your child can be in a forward-facing seat in the back seat of the car.</li>
  <li>One of the most important jobs you have as a parent is keeping your child safe when riding in a vehicle. Each year thousands of young children are killed or injured in car crashes. Proper use of car seats helps keep children safe. For information on proper care seat installation and safety guidelines please review our <a href="car-seat-safety.html">car seat safety tips</a>.</li>
  <li>Provide close supervision. Make sure your child rides her tricycle away from the street and always wears a helmet.</li>
  <li>Keep matches and lighters, medicines, and hazardous materials out of reach.</li>
  <li>Leave a night light on in case your child wakes in the night or has a bad dream.</li>
  <li>Help your child learn to cross streets and walk safely through parking lots.</li>
  <li>Never leave your child unsupervised around bodies of water, such as bathtubs and swimming pools. Dont rely on a life jacket to keep her safe.</li>
  <li>Apply generous amounts of sunscreen and lip balm with SPF 15, or higher, 15-30 minutes before going outside. Reapply sunscreen if it gets washed off due to swimming or sweating.</li>
  <li>Limit exposure to the sun between 11:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. when the suns rays are the strongest.</li>
</ul>
