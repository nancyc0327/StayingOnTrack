<h1>About The Early Development Network</h1>
<p>
	Early intervention can help you and your family support and promote your child's development, within your family activities and community life. Nebraska's Early Development Network supports children birth through three years of age who have special developmental needs. The Nebraska Early Development Network program 'connects' families with early intervention services, such as occupational, speech or physical therapy, to help infants and toddlers grow and develop and help their families in this process. It is a voluntary program and does not discriminate based on race, culture, religion, income level, or disability.

<p class='disclaimer'>If you have concerns about your childâ€™s development talk to your doctor or <a href='inapp://contactForm' class='contactForm'>contact the Early Development Network</a>.</p>
