<h2>School Readiness</h2>
<h2>What Will Kindergarten be Like?</h2>
<p>Kindergarten is for ALL five-year-olds. It is normal for children to be at different levels of development, with a wide range of abilities. Kindergartners quickly gain skills and knowledge and often catch up with each other by the end of the year.<br />
Nebraska teachers plan their curriculum based on state standards, which are what children should know and be able to do by the end of the school year in: language arts (reading, writing, and communicating), mathematics, science, and social studies.</p>
<p> Recognizing that young children are active learners and learn best through play, many kindergarten teachers provide plenty of time for play and exploration. However, kindergarten programs have come under pressure to become more structured and academic. This may cause some parents to be concerned about their child’s ability to be successful.<br />
  Because each classroom may have different expectations and daily schedules, it is important that parents talk to the teacher or principal if you are unsure about your child’s ability to be successful.</p>
  
<p class='disclaimer'>If you have concerns about your child’s development talk to your doctor or <a href='inapp://contactForm' class='contactForm'>contact the Early Development Network</a>.</p>
