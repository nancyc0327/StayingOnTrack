<h2>When Can My Child Start Kindergarten?</h2>
<p>Nebraska law entitles children to receive free public education the year that they turn five on or before July 31. This is called a “cutoff date.” Schools cannot test age-eligible children for kindergarten entrance, nor suggest delaying entrance. It is the responsibility of schools to be ready to meet the individual needs of every age-eligible child, regardless of their abilities.</p>
<h2>What If My Child Doesn't Meet the Cutoff Date?</h2>
<p>School districts are allowed to enroll a child who misses the cutoff date, but turns five between August 1 and October 15. Parents who are interested in enrolling their child early should contact their school as soon as possible to ask about the procedure for early entry assessment.</p>
