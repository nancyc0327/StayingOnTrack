<h2>Support Growth and Learning</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Let your child take the lead while you respond to the play she selects.</li>
  <li>A toddler likes to play by pretending to do the same things that she sees others do, such as cooking a meal, dressing up (especially in hats and shoes), or talking on the telephone.</li>
  <li>Sit with your child for brief periods of time at a small table to play with a toy or draw. Toddlers may think they are forming letters when they scribble; encourage this first step toward writing.</li>
  <li>Experiment with art materials. Toddlers like using finger paint and fat crayons on large sheets of paper.</li>
  <li>Sing, count, talk, listen and READ, READ, READ to your child.</li>
  <li>Play with toy trucks, dolls, ride-on toys, blocks, and simple puzzles and shape toys.</li>
  <li>Daily routines can be fun. Use bath time as a time to talk about the way the water feels, see what sinks or floats, what bubbles, and what happens when you gently splash.</li>
  <li>Give your child simple tasks such as finding a book or getting her jacket.</li>
  <li>Although your child enjoys being with other children, sharing is still difficult. You might provide duplicate toys, when possible, to avoid incidents.</li>
  <li>Children enjoy going to the grocery store, and on other outings. If your toddler is well rested and in a good mood, the outing will be enjoyable for both of you.</li>
  <li>Help your toddler become independent in a positive way. Keep the rules simple, repeat the rules frequently, stay calm and have patience, and don’t expect too much – she is still learning.</li>
  <li>By age 2&#189;, your toddler may be ready to learn about using the potty/toilet. During the day, suggest she sit on the potty/toilet. It is important that she wears training pants (not diapers) while she is learning. Encourage and praise her for her efforts and for her successes. Do not pressure or scold her. </li>
</ul>
<h2>If Your Child Bites</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Watch for signs that your child might bite and give her a safe alternative such as a toy or teething ring to bite.</li>
  <li>Gently but firmly say to her: "Ouch! Biting hurts. Please don’t bite."</li>
  <li>Praise your child for not biting.</li>
  <li>NEVER bite your child back. This will hurt and frighten her and she may learn that biting is okay if you are bigger.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Developing Good Feelings</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Your child may have strong feelings – be there to comfort her.</li>
  <li>Show pride and pleasure in the things she does well.</li>
  <li>Be firm with your child, but be in control of your own emotions.</li>
  <li>Enjoy special cuddly moments with your child, but you may need to wait until she is ready.</li>
  <li>Develop routines for bedtime and meals.</li>
  <li>Help her learn and use words to get what she needs.</li>
  <li>Help her find acceptable ways to express her feelings.</li>
</ul>
  <h2>Sharing Books with Your Toddler</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Choose simple picture books that help him make sense of concepts such as size, color, shape and time.</li>
  <li>Choose books with flaps to lift and textures to feel.</li>
  <li>Read wordless picture books and storybooks with brief, simple plots and only a few words on each page.</li>
  <li>Choose books with rhymes and predictable words he can remember.</li>
  <li>Look for books with lots of pictures of things to name.</li>
  <li>Choose books you will enjoy reading over and over.</li>
  <li>Reading at bedtime will help your toddler "settle down" after a busy day and will bring a smooth, happy ending to the day.</li>
</ul>
