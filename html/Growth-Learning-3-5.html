<h2>Support Growth and Learning</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Provide a variety of things to play with; this can include things from around the house.</li>
  <li>Cut the front of a cereal box into several pieces to make a simple puzzle and help your child put it back together.</li>
  <li>Put a blanket over a card table. Let your child create a house inside.</li>
  <li>Do exercises together to musicjumping jacks, toe touches, bend from side to side.</li>
  <li>Plant some seeds, care for them, and watch them grow.</li>
  <li>Make a sandwich together. First its a square, then cut diagonally it becomes two triangles.</li>
  <li>Have your child help you set the table or match socks.</li>
  <li>Read books together.</li>
  <li>Children this age love to tell stories. They have great imaginations and can be very creative.</li>
  <li>Enjoy their tall tales.<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Guiding Behavior</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Set a few simple rules. Your child needs limits to feel secure.</li>
  <li>Provide a simple explanation for each rule.</li>
  <li>Be positive. Say, walk in the house rather than, dont run.</li>
  <li>Be consistent. If the rule is to walk in the house, dont play running games inside.</li>
  <li>Use logical or natural consequences. If he doesnt wear mittens when playing in the snow, his hands will get cold.</li>
  <li>Model good behavior. Your child learns from watching you.</li>
  <li>Allow your child to make simple choices and then honor his decision. Ask him, Do you want peas or carrots?</li>
  <li>Some children may be aggressivethey try biting, hitting, pushing, and throwing things. Try to stop a situation before it gets to this point.</li>
  <li>Help your child find a different activity when things arent going well.</li>
  <li>Always keep safety first. Stay close to your child during a tantrum.</li>
  <li>Help your child think of an acceptable solution to resolve his problem or conflict.</li>
  <li>Help your child verbalize his feelings of anger, frustration or sadness.</li>
  <li>Let your child know when you like the way he is behaving.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Share Books With Your Child</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Read stories with simple plots she can retell in her own words. Read books with rhymes, phrases, and story lines that let her participate.</li>
  <li>As she learns new concepts and self-help skills, read stories with characters who are having similar experiences.</li>
  <li>Read longer picture books, and around age five start to read chapter books that last for several sessions.</li>
  <li>Read books that let her use her knowledge to understand new information and ideas.</li>
  <li>Read poems and books with rhymes that help her learn about the sounds of letters and words.</li>
  <li>Visit your local library. Many libraries have a preschool story time. Check to see at what age your preschooler can get a library card.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Watching Television With Your Child</h2>
<ul>
  <li>View programs with her.</li>
  <li>Select shows appropriate for her age.</li>
  <li>Place limits on the amount of daily &amp; weekly viewing.</li>
  <li>Set certain periods when the TV will be off</li>
</ul>
