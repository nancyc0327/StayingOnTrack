<h2>How Can I Help My Child be Ready?</h2>
<p>High quality early care and education programs provide children with opportunities to develop the skills related to school success through play. But there are many things parents can do to help children be successful in school and in life. You can:</p>
<h3> <strong>Promote good healthy habits by making sure your child:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li> Follows a routine which includes a balanced diet and plenty of activity and rest</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Encourage social and emotional well-being by giving your child chances to:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Take care of own needs, such as dressing &amp; toileting</li>
  <li>Play with others, learning to share and cooperate</li>
  <li>Express emotions in safe ways, learning to control his/her own behaviors and reactions</li>
  <li> Pay attention, make choices, follow directions &amp; rules</li>
</ul>
<h3> <strong>Support language and learning by giving your child chances to:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Be read to every day &amp; talk about words you see</li>
  <li>Practice drawing, writing, and recognizing numbers, shapes, colors, letters, sounds and her/his name</li>
  <li>Work on a task until it’s done, with support as needed</li>
  <li> Play! Children learn best when they’re having fun, so use games, toys, natural events and routines to teach, rather than using flashcards and worksheets.</li>
</ul>

<p class='disclaimer'>If you have concerns about your child’s development talk to your doctor or <a href='inapp://contactForm' class='contactForm'>contact the Early Development Network</a>.</p>
