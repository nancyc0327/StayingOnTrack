<h1>About </h1>
<p>The Ready for Success was created by the Nebraska Department of Education and used here on the Staying on Track App. Ready for Success is in response to commonly asked questions from parents about preparing for, and entering kindergarten.</p>
<p> Some questions parents ask are about district policy. Nebraska has over 200 individual school districts, each having their own board, superintendent, and policies. The Nebraska Department of Education provides guidance and assistance to these districts. Understanding what is state law (such as the entrance age) and what is district policy (such as the early entry assessment procedure) can be confusing. Parents are encouraged to talk with school teachers and administrators for specific guidance. </p>
<p>Ready for Success is a booklet and translated into several languages. The booklet  can be downloaded here:<a href="https://www.education.ne.gov/oec/ready_for_success.html"> https://www.education.ne.gov/oec/ready_for_success.html</a></p>
