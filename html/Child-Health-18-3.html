<h2>Tips to Keep Your Toddler Healthy (18 mos.-3 yrs.):</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Keep your home smoke-free. Secondary smoke can increase the chances of respiratory illness.</li>
  <li>Wash your hands and your toddler’s hands with soap and running water often to prevent the spread of germs. Help him learn the proper procedure for hand washing.</li>
  <li>Developing a naptime routine will help your toddler sleep better.</li>
  <li>Use a child-sized, soft bristle toothbrush, and after age 2 a pea-sized amount of toothpaste after each meal.</li>
  <li>Visit the dentist every 6 months or as indicated by his needs. Ask the dentist about the need for fluoride.</li>
  <li>Continue with well-child visits to the doctor.</li>
  <li>Unless you notice a need, your child’s first visit to an eye doctor for a thorough vision examination should be by age three.</li>
  <li>keep a copy of your child's immunization record among your important papers. (<a href="Immunizations.html">View a list of Nebraska's recommended immunizations</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Building a Healthy Body</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner and 2 or 3 healthy snacks every day. Offer smaller amounts, about 1/4 to 1/3 the size of a grown up serving. Let your child decide when she has had enough to eat. If she is not hungry at a meal, she will eat again at snack time.</li>
  <li>Offer water between meals and when your child is thirsty. Serve milk at mealtime. Limit juice – she only needs about 4-6 ounces of 100% fruit juice per day.</li>
  <li>Your child depends upon you to learn new things. Offer her at least 5 fruits and vegetables each day. Offer some of
her favorite foods and some new foods. She may or may not try a new food when first offered. If she does not eat it this time, she will try it some other time. Keep serving the food. Make trying new foods fun. Teach about the different colors and shapes of fruits and vegetables.</li>
  <li>Make meals memorable. Take time to eat together and talk with your family. Family meals teach children to like healthy foods. They also teach children eye-hand coordination and table manners. Turn off the TV during meals. TV distracts children and makes them overeat.</li>
  <li>Set a good example. Offer healthy foods and let your child see you eating them too.</li>
  <li>Active kids are healthy kids. Encourage your child to play actively for one to two hours every day. She will like to run, jump and climb. Play active games with her.</li>
  <li>Provide time to play outdoors whenever possible.</li>
  <li>Limit TV viewing to no more than 1 hour per day.</li>
</ul>
