<h2>School Readiness</h2>
<h3>What does School Rediness Mean?</h3>
<p>Children are born ready and eager to learn. The goal of school readiness efforts is to support ALL children entering kindergarten with the skills, knowledge, health, and attitude to be successful life-long learners. Ready children have families who support their children’s learning, and schools that are prepared to meet the individual needs of ALL children the year they are age-eligible to attend kindergarten.</p>

<p class='disclaimer'>If you have concerns about your child’s development talk to your doctor or <a href='inapp://contactForm' class='contactForm'>contact the Early Development Network</a>.</p>
