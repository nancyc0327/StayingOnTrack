<h2>Tips to Keep Your Toddler Safe (18 mos.-3 yrs.):</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Nebraska law requires that children up to 6 years of age be in restraints when riding in a vehicle. From age one to about age four and 20-40 pounds, your toddler can be in a forward-facing seat in the back seat of the car.</li>
  <li>One of the most important jobs you have as a parent is keeping your child safe when riding in a vehicle. Each year thousands of young children are killed or injured in car crashes. Proper use of car seats helps keep children safe. For information on proper care seat installation and safety guidelines please review our <a href="car-seat-safety.html">car seat safety tips</a>.</li>
  <li>Provide close supervision wherever your child is playing. Toddlers are at an increased risk for fallrelated injuries.</li>
  <li>Toddlers like to play outside. Make sure the yard fence is high enough and all gates are securely latched.</li>
  <li>If you have not already done so, now is the time to ―toddler proof‖ your home. Place breakable things up high where your child can’t reach them. Make sure that electrical outlets are covered and secure other things that might be dangerous. Use child-proof containers for toxic substances and keep them out of reach.</li>
  <li>Leave a night light on in case your toddler climbs out of bed or has a bad dream.</li>
  <li>Watch out for small objects (bugs, pins, jewelry, buttons) that might easily slip into your toddler’s mouth. Anything small enough to fall through a toilet paper roll is too small for him.</li>
  <li>It is still easy for toddlers to choke on foods, so watch for foods such as
popcorn, pretzels, chips, hot dogs, peanut butter, raw carrots, mini-marshmallows,
raisins and other dried fruits, and whole grapes.</li>
  <li>Learn infant/toddler CPR and first aid.</li>
  <li>Never leave your toddler unsupervised around bodies of water, such as bathtubs
and swimming pools. Don’t rely on a life jacket to keep him safe.</li>
  <li>Always remove toys from swimming pools when finished swimming so that your
toddler won’t be tempted to reach in to retrieve them.</li>
  <li>Apply generous amounts of sunscreen and lip balm with SPF 15, or higher, 15-30
minutes before going outside. Reapply sunscreen if it gets washed off due to swimming or sweating.</li>
  <li>Limit exposure to the sun between 11:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. when the sun’s rays are the strongest.</li>
</ul>
