<h2>Tips to Keep Your Baby Healthy (0-18 months):</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Keep the environment smoke-free to reduce the chance of respiratory illness, ear infection, and SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome).</li>
  <li>Keep your baby at a safe temperature that is not too hot or too cold.</li>
  <li>Wash your hands and your baby's hands often to prevent the spread of germs.</li>
  <li>Keep up with your baby's well-baby visits to the doctor.</li>
  <li>If your baby's eyes were not examined for signs of eye health and congenital eye problems before you left the hospital, ask your doctor to check when you go for a well-baby check.</li>
  <li>If your baby's hearing was not screened before you left the hospital, ask your doctor to check when you go for a well-baby check.</li>
  <li>keep a copy of your baby's immunization record among your important papers. (<a href="Immunizations.html">View a list of Nebraska's recommended immunizations</a>.)</li>
  <li>for the first 6 months of life. Breastfeeding helps your baby resist colds, ear infections, diarrhea, allergies 
    and other illnesses.</li>
  <li>When your baby can sit with support and has good head and neck control, solid foods can be introduced. It is 
    recommended that solid foods be introduced in this order: iron fortified infant cereal, vegetables and fruits, 
  and then meats.</li>
  <li>Begin to wean your baby gradually at about 9-10 months. By 12-14 months most babies can drink from a cup.</li>
  <li>After your baby is 1 year old, you can offer small portions of what the rest of the family is eating. Bread, 
    pasta or rice, fruits and vegetables, cheese or yogurt and cooked lean meat, poultry, or eggs are all good 
    choices. Make sure the pieces are small enough so he will not choke.</li>
  <li>Mouth care begins at birth. Clean his mouth with a soft damp washcloth.</li>
  <li>First teeth appear at about 6 months of age. Clean his teeth gently with a soft-bristled toothbrush. (No toothpaste is needed until age 2, unless your dentist recommends it.)</li>
  <li>Dentists recommend that if your baby takes a bottle before bedtime, you should give only water to prevent tooth decay.</li>
  <li>Your baby's first dental visit should be by age one.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Call The Doctor If Your Baby...</h2>

  <li>has diarrhea or very small, hard stools.</li>
  <li>is vomiting for more than 12 hours.</li>
  <li>cries more than normal and is hard to comfort in the usual ways.</li>
  <li>has yellow, bluish, or pale skin.</li>
  <li>does not wake up on his own for feedings or seems too tired to eat.</li>
