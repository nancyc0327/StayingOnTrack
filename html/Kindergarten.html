<h3>Make sure that your child:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>is well nourished and has his health needs met</li>
  <li>has plenty of opportunities to develop physically through vigorous play and use of building materials of various kinds</li>
  <li>has a language-rich environment through conversation and being read to on a daily basis</li>
  <li>has a wide variety of play-oriented experiences which add to his general knowledge about the world</li>
  <li>has a personal sense of well-being and confidence in his abilities</li>
  <li>is encouraged to be curious, creative, independent, cooperative, persistent and responsible in age appropriate 
    ways</li>
</ul>
<p>When registering your child for kindergarten, you will need his official birth certificate, the results of a<br />
