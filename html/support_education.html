<h2>How can I Support my Child's Education?</h2>
<p>Starting kindergarten is a time of change for both your child and your family. It is common for parents and children to feel nervous about the new routines and expectations. The more you know, the better prepared you and your child will feel.</p>
<h2> To Help Your Child, You Can:</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Be enthusiastic and positive when you talk with your child about the changes. If you are excited and confident, your child will be, too.</li>
  <li> Make an appointment with your doctor or clinic for the kindergarten check-up.</li>
  <li>Contact the school you want your child to attend:
    <ul>
      <li> Ask how and when to enroll. You will need your child’s original birth certificate.</li>
      <li>Request information about school expectations, rules, and classroom daily routines.</li>
      <li>Ask about start and release times, which may vary between schools.</li>
      <li>If you will need before or after school care or transportation, be sure to ask what options are available from the school or in your community.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Talk with your childcare provider about adjusting your current routine (such as naptime) to help<br />
    prepare your child for the new daily schedule.</li>
  <li>Read books about kindergarten and encourage your child to talk about his/her feelings.</li>
  <li>Participate in school open houses and information meetings. Help your child feel more comfortable and confident by knowing what will happen, where things are, whom she knows, and what to look forward to.</li>
  <li>Meet with your child’s teacher, especially if you feel your child may need individual attention or support.</li>
  <li>Start a new bed time and morning routine a few days before school starts. A routine will help your child get the 10-12 hours of sleep needed.</li>
  <li>Talk with your child about what you will each do on that first day. Consider sending a small visual reminder, such as a family photo to provide comfort.</li>
  <li>Arrive at school early to give your child time to settle in. Remind your child about your plans for the end of the school day. Give a reassuring, cheerful, and short good-bye.</li>
</ul>
