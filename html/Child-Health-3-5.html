<h2>Tips to Keep Your Child Healthy (3-5 years):</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Continue to visit the dentist every 6 months or as needed by your child. Ask your dentist if there is enough fluoride in the drinking water or if you need to use toothpaste with fluoride.</li>
  <li>Assist your child with brushing teeth at least twice a day. Use a child-size, soft-bristle toothbrush and a pea-sized amount of toothpaste.</li>
  <li>Keep your home smoke-free. Secondary smoke can increase the chances of respiratory illness.</li>
  <li>Wash your hands and assist your child to wash his hands with soap and running water often to prevent the spread of germs. Help him learn the proper procedure for hand washing.</li>
  <li>Preschoolers may sleep 10 to 12 hours at night and may not need a nap.</li>
  <li>Serve healthy foods for meals and snacks.</li>
  <li>Let your child choose how much food to eat at a meal and let him stop eating when he is full.</li>
  <li>Your child should drink about 2 cups of milk each day. Give water to him between meals or whenever he is thirsty. You can offer him ½ to ¾ cup 100% fruit juice per day. Drinking more than this can reduce his appetite for other healthy foods.</li>
  <li>Be a positive role model  practice healthy eating behaviors yourself.</li>
  <li>Continue with well-child visits to the doctor.</li>
  <li>Encourage your child to be physically active by playing tag or ball, and jumping, climbing and running.</li>
  <li>Active kids are healthy kids. Encourage your child to play actively for one to two hours every day.</li>
  <li>keep a copy of your child's immunization record among your important papers. (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf">View a list of Nebraska's recommended immunizations</a>.)</li>
</ul>
